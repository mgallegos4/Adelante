            The two most common college entrance exams are the SAT and the ACT. It’s important to consider the differences
            and see which test plays to your strengths more. For instance the ACT contains a science section, while the SAT
            does not. The tests are also offered at different times throughout the year and it is important to take them early
            enough before college applications are due. For more information, <a href = " https://www.studypoint.com/ed/act-vs-sat/"> click here!</a>

          <h1>Extracurriculars in High School</h1>
          <p class="w3-text-grey">
            Extracurricular activities are a great way to stand out on a college application. Colleges really pay attention to
            the quality and quantity of organizations you participate in because if you are applying for a certain major, and
            have lots of extracurriculars to support your interest in that major, then it makes you look better as an applicant.
            Colleges want to know how often you participate, and how that organization has helped you. They emphasize community
            service and want to know about any awards or recognitions you have received. Don’t worry if you don’t have an extensive
            extracurricular activity portfolio! Sometimes less is more. If you spend a lot of time in one extracurricular, it shows
            that you are a committed person; a great quality in a college student. Extracurriculars also can help you figure out what
            types of work you like and don’t like. More information can be found <a href = "https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/2018-10-25/how-colleges-weigh-applicants-extracurricular-activities">here!</a>

          <h1>What Colleges look for in Students</h1>
          <p class="w3-text-grey">
            College say they take a holistic approach to the application process, which means they consider the following: GPA and CLass Rank, AP and Honors Classes, Extracurriculars, Volunteer and Work Experience, Test Scores, Recommendation Letters, Application Essays, Talents, and Passions. While this list does appear daunting, it's important to remember that colleges want to see you, the want to be able to see the individual behind the application. It’s also important to note that colleges aren’t looking for perfection, they’re looking for individuals who can bring something to their campus.

          <p class="w3-text-grey"> There’s a lot of things to consider when applying to colleges. Some questions to ask yourself are:</p>
          <p class="w3-text-grey">  How many students graduate in four years? What’s the retention rate? In other words, how many students return after their first year?</p>
          <p class="w3-text-grey">  What opportunities are available? Consider: Internships, Research, Alumni, Study Abroad Programs. </p>
          <p class="w3-text-grey">  Consider what you want from a college: Size? Location? Student-to-Faculty Ratio?  </p>

          <h1>In-State vs. Out of state and Private vs. Public</h1>
          <p class="w3-text-grey">The main differences between public and private schools are tuition and sizes. Public schools are generally less expensive because they are funded by state governments. Public schools are also typically bigger and offer a greater range of degree options. Private schools, on the other hand, don’t receive funds from state legislatures and rely on tuition and private donations. They also have a smaller student population and smaller class sizes. Private universities typically have less variety in degree options and tend to have a particular academic focus.</p>
          <p class="w3-text-grey">Choosing between staying in-state or going out-of-state can be hard. Both choices have their pros. If you choose to stay in-state, you will have the comfort of home and you will be prepared for whatever weather changes are going to occur. If you go out-of-state, you can have a chance to experience a new place and be more independent.</p>
