We created a tool for schools to distribute to their students to help them in their mission to educate
their students and prepare them for a brighter future. It also helps schools facilitate their students
finding the best learning environment for them after high school.

College is an important stepping stone in life and can be a greatly beneficial experience for many. 
However, the process of getting into college, and figuring out what you want to do with your life, can 
be a daunting and complicated process. What we hope our website provides students with resources and 
information, without overwhelming them too much, and help navigate and manage the college application 
process so that they can take charge of their future and give themselves the best possible opportunity 
for success. By having schools distribute this site/resource to their students, students and their families 
will know how to progress with their high school career and external educations/activities.
