    <h3 class=oddH>Saving Money</h3>
    <p class=oddT>Remember that you have to re-apply for the FAFSA each year, and continue to apply for scholarships throughout college. Your school may even have a databases or resources for you to find scholarships. Consider getting an on-campus job.
    </p>

    <h3 class=evenH>Living on Campus</h3>
    <p class=evenT>Housing can be confusing. Talk to students already attending the school to see what their housing experiences have been like. Depending on where your school is located, off-campus housing may be cheaper or more expensive. </p>

    <h3 class=oddH>Good Study Habits</h3>
    <p class=oddT>Good study habits are important. Try to meet people in your classes to make friends and form study groups. Reach out for help. See what tutoring or advising options are available to you, go to office hours. Ask for help before it’s too late. </p>

    <h3 class=evenH>Moving Away from Home</h3>
    <p class=evenT>Moving away from home can be daunting. Consider where you are going to school and how close or far away it is from home. See if you have any family living nearby or what support system you may be able to build outside of school.</p>

    <h3 class=oddH>Making a Four Year Plan to Graduate on Time</h3>
    <p class=oddT>A four-year plan is important. It’s not necessary to completely stick with it, but it is always good to know where you stand and even if it’s possible for you to graduate early. An advisor should be able to help you map out your classes and help you
        design a four-year plan. </p>

    <h3 class=evenH>Joining Clubs</h3>
    <p class=evenT>Clubs are not only a great way to meet people, they’re also a great way to get involved. You can join a major related club and meet more people in your major, or join a club with a purpose you’re passionate about. </p>
