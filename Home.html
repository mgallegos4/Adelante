        <h1>About Adelante</h1>
        <p class="text"> &nbsp We have built a tool for students to help them with their goal of education and preparing themselves for a brighter future. College is an important stepping stone in life and can be a greatly beneficial experience for many. However, the
            process of applying to college, and figuring out what you want to do with your life, is daunting and complicated.</p>
        <p class="text"> &nbsp Our goal is that our website provides students with resources and information, without overwhelming them, so that they are able to navigate and manage the college application process and take charge of their future giving themselves the
            best possible opportunity for success. By having schools distribute this site/resource to their students, our hope is that students and their families will be better equipped to build and make decisions about their futures.
